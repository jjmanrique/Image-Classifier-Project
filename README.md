# Image Classifier Project

Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. Recently, it has become one of the top applications in Machine Learning.

In this capstone project, proposed in the Facebook Pytorch Scholarship Challenge, I designed a classifier to identify 102 species of flowers. For the network structure, I imported the Resnet18 model that deals with image classification using Convolutional layers.

The training process was performed in a notebook on a Google Colab GPU and used Pytorch for the structure.
